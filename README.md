# ðŸ“Š Superstore SQL Queries  

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze the Superstore dataset from Tableau's **[sample data](https://public.tableau.com/app/learn/sample-data)**. The queries showcase a range of SQL concepts, including data aggregation, filtering, window functions, and subqueries.  

## **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset contains sales, profit, and order data for a fictional superstore, covering product categories, subcategories, shipping modes, and customer orders. The analysis focuses on performance for the year 2017 with comparisons to previous years.  

## **Objectives**  
This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL by:  
- Extracting key performance metrics such as profit, sales, and quantity.  
- Analyzing product performance by subcategory and identifying top-performing items.  
- Evaluating shipping mode efficiency and order distribution.  
- Using advanced SQL techniques to identify trends and patterns for business insights.  

## **SQL Concepts Demonstrated**  
1. **Data Aggregation**: Summing sales, profits, and quantities.  
2. **Grouping and Filtering**: Grouping by product category, subcategory, and shipping modes.  
3. **Window Functions**: Ranking products by sales using `RANK()`.  
4. **Subqueries**: Identifying categories with the highest sales in each region.  
5. **Conditional Logic**: Using `CASE` statements for custom groupings.  

## **About**  
This project is part of a broader portfolio showcasing data analytics and visualization skills. The same dataset has been visualized in **[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/views/SuperstoreSales_17321429271930/SuperstorePerformance?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**, where key metrics and trends are highlighted in an interactive dashboard.

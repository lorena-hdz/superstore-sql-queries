# ðŸ“Š Superstore SQL Queries  

This repository contains a collection of SQL queries designed to analyze and generate insights from the Superstore dataset. The queries showcase a range of SQL concepts, including data aggregation, filtering, window functions, and subqueries.  

## **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset contains sales, profit, and order data for a fictional superstore, covering product categories, subcategories, shipping modes, and customer orders. The analysis focuses on performance for the year 2017 with comparisons to previous years.  

## **Objectives**  
This project demonstrates proficiency in SQL by:  
- Extracting key performance metrics such as profit, sales, and quantity.  
- Analyzing product performance by subcategory and identifying top-performing items.  
- Evaluating shipping mode efficiency and order distribution.  
- Using advanced SQL techniques to identify trends and patterns for business insights.  

## **SQL Concepts Demonstrated**  
1. **Data Aggregation**: Summing sales, profits, and quantities.  
2. **Grouping and Filtering**: Grouping by product category, subcategory, and shipping modes.  
3. **Window Functions**: Ranking products by sales using `RANK()`.  
4. **Subqueries**: Identifying categories with the highest sales in each region.  
5. **Conditional Logic**: Using `CASE` statements for custom groupings.  

## **Featured SQL Queries**  

### ðŸ”¹ **Total Sales, Profit, and Quantity for 2017**  
```sql
SELECT 
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales, 
    SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit, 
    SUM(Quantity) AS Total_Quantity 
FROM superstore 
WHERE YEAR(Order_Date) = 2017;
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Top 5 Products by Sales**
```sql
SELECT 
    Product_Name, 
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales 
FROM superstore 
GROUP BY Product_Name 
ORDER BY Total_Sales DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Year-over-Year Sales Growth**
```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(Order_Date) AS Year, 
    SUM(Sales) AS Total_Sales 
FROM superstore 
WHERE YEAR(Order_Date) IN (2016, 2017) 
GROUP BY YEAR(Order_Date) 
ORDER BY Year;
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Orders Shipped Same-Day vs. Other Shipping Modes**
```sql
SELECT 
    CASE 
        WHEN Shipping_Mode = 'Same Day' THEN 'Same Day' 
        ELSE 'Other Modes' 
    END AS Shipping_Type, 
    COUNT(Order_ID) AS Total_Orders 
FROM superstore 
GROUP BY Shipping_Type;
``` 

## **Skills Highlighted**  
- Proficiency in SQL for data analysis and business intelligence.  
- Expertise in crafting complex queries for real-world datasets.  
- Clear and efficient data visualization and interpretation.
